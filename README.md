# Chrome-Extension
<h4>
This is chrome extension which helps you to keep track of all the links you want to save. As a sales representative this tool is highly useful because you have to move to different websites and check on profiles and others and save their profile links but since it's very tedious to store them somewhere, leads-tracker helps you to do that and hence a lot of time is saved.</h4>
